# QxQ-QuantumQiskit
Here is all of my quantum computing work. More to come soon!
Currently enrolled in The Coding School's QxQ course along with 7000 international students. First ever quantum computing course for high school students.
Sponsored by IBM Quantum.
Primarily used IBM Qiskit and IBM Quantum Experience.
Check out the Grover's Algorithm folder to see an implementation of Grover's Search Algorithm in Qiskit!
